MTL Pulse is a project made for the Montreal Yelp Hackathon 2016.

The project extract data from Yelp's academic dataset and map this data onto a road map of Montreal provided by OpenStreetMap to provide a timelapse of Montreal's Yelpers' activity throughout the week.

Paraview, a multi-platform data analysis and visualization platform is used to combine Montreal's map and Yelp's data.

Parser.py format JSON data into .csv files that are need for Paraview to extract the required information and build the timelapse.
